# Business Formation Statistics by State

[Final Visualization](https://justinkraus.github.io/BFS/)

I was attracted to the business formation statistics (BFS) dataset as Iâ€™m interested in exploring alternative methodologies that measure where jobs are growing in the US. The BFS data is an experimental measure for measuring economic activity, meaning its not a formal measurement that guides Federal monetary policy, but is something that is being considered and refined for future use. 

## Iteration 1

1.  Acquired data from census site: [https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/index.html](https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/index.html)
    
2.  At the link above you'll find Tableau dashboards that capture short time periods of BFS data. However I set-out to measure aggregated business application for the entire time period available to determine which states have had the most business applications since 2006.
    
3.  Merged data at the state-level with a state shape file to to create a choropleth map in kepler: [https://alicia.data.socrata.com/Government/States-21basic/jhnu-yfrj](https://alicia.data.socrata.com/Government/States-21basic/jhnu-yfrj),

All corporate business applications from 2006-present, darker purple indicates more activity

As much as [I like using Kepler](https://github.com/justinkraus/Cartography), I realized a lot of the functionality that had attracted me to Kepler in the past (interactivity and high granularity) was unnecessary for a state-level choropleth.

## Iteration 2
In the initial dataset, three types of business formation statistics are provided. I refocused the visual to observe only on "high-propensity business applications" which the census bureau believes will likely translate into a wage paying job as opposed to more general business activities. Additionally I added a column filter that separates items into two time intervals: 2006-October 2020 and March-October 2020 to observe if there had been any material impacts from the lockdown measures on new business applications by state. 

Additionally I decided to use d3.js for this update as per the reasons mentioned in the previous section:

 - The [current script](https://github.com/justinkraus/BFS/blob/master/index.html) loads a csv of the business applications for each time period
 - Merges them to a [JSON file containing the states shapes](https://github.com/justinkraus/BFS/blob/master/us-states.json)
 - Colors states by number of business applications.
